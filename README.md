# Pooper Scooper

## Description

Pooper Scooper is an arcade action game where you try to keep your lawn pristine as wild animals dash across it, pooping everywhere. Clean up the poops, but don't get run over by the wild beasts!

## Stack

HTML
CSS
Javascript

The approach for this game is to use classes and object-oriented programming.

## MVP

- Render the game in a browser
- Have logic for winning and losing
- Organize your code in separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## MVP

- Have a game board ./
- Have a player ./
- Have a score 
- Have enemies that dash across the screen from all edges  - Left ./
- Enemies leave poop behind randomly ./
- Player has to stand on poop to clean it ./
- Standing in poop slows down the player ./
- Cleaning up poop increases the player's score
